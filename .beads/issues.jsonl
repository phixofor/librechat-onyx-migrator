{"id":"librechat-migrator-270","title":"Fix imported attachments so Onyx can download them","description":"Imported messages reference attachments, but clicking them in the Onyx UI returns a 404. Investigation findings (Dec 3, 2025):\n- `chat_message.files` entries point at `user_file.id` values (e.g., `229a4849-1c19-42e1-9515-12402c5c8590`).\n- Those rows exist in `user_file`, but hitting `/api/files/\u003cuser_file_id\u003e` returns `{\"detail\":\"404: Not Found\"}`.\n- S3 bucket `onyx-file-store-bucket` only contains keys like `onyx-files/public/\u003cuuid\u003e`, whereas our importer uploads to `user-files/\u003clibrechat_file_id\u003e` (default `S3_FILE_PREFIX`). Head-object for `user-files/...` fails with 404, so the binaries never landed where Onyx expects them.\n- Result: UI can't load the attachment binaries, even though metadata exists in Postgres.\n\nWork needed:\n1. Align the importer’s upload key with Onyx’s convention (likely `onyx-files/public/\u003cuser_file_id\u003e` or whatever backend uses when generating signed URLs).\n2. Re-upload/copy existing attachments (or re-import with the corrected prefix) so previously imported chats regain working file links.\n3. Ensure `lc-mig.py import-chats --copy-files` errors loudly when a referenced file can’t be found, so we know which binaries remain missing.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- New imports upload files to the correct S3 key so `/api/files/\u003cuser_file_id\u003e` returns 200.\n- Provide a repair path (script or documented steps) to migrate existing uploaded files to the correct location or re-import affected sessions.\n- Add validation or logging in the importer to surface attachment upload failures immediately.","notes":"Fixed file download failures by normalizing legacy file_record.file_origin values to uppercase enum names: ran UPDATE to replace chat_upload/chat_image_gen/connector/user_file with their uppercase equivalents, aligning with backend’s Enum definition.
